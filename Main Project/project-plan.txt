Final Project Layout

App Name: Medi-Aid

Application Use: Medi-Aid allows users to use the api ApiMedic to search for potential health problems they may have, and then make a post on the global feed to allow doctors to view and comment. Each post is anonymous to other users if a patient is logged in, but when the application is used with a doctor's account, the doctor can view a post and see the user's name and respond accordingly to a patient's problem. Additionally, users can also modify their user settings such as changing their password, and they can also choose to delete their account if they wish.


Application Functionalities

1. Home page that displays either:

A patient account's posts, in which they can see the list of posts that they have made. 

And for the other type of account, a doctor's account (which is a list of the most recent posts), they can comment on patient's posts. 

2. Edit User Account Settings, which involves features such as password changing and delete account

3. Search Bar - Each post will have a list of symptoms, and we're able to search through all the posts currently available using a basic symptom keyword such as "dizzy".
